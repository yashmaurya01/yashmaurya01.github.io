summary: "Convolutional Neural Networks have been known as black-box models as humans cannot interpret their inner functionalities. With an attempt to make CNNs more interpretable and trustworthy, we propose IS-CAM (Integrated Score-CAM), where we introduce the integration operation within the Score-CAM pipeline to achieve visually sharper attribution maps quantitatively. Our method is evaluated on 2000 randomly selected images from the ILSVRC 2012 Validation dataset, which proves the versatility of IS-CAM to account for different models and methods."

##### Abstract

Convolutional Neural Networks have been known as blackbox models as humans cannot interpret their inner functionalities. With
an attempt to make CNNs more interpretable and trustworthy, we propose IS-CAM (Integrated Score-CAM), where we introduce the integration operation within the Score-CAM pipeline to achieve visually sharper
attribution maps quantitatively. Our method is evaluated on 2000 randomly selected images from the ILSVRC 2012 Validation dataset, which
proves the versatility of IS-CAM to account for different models and
methods.
