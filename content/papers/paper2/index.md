summary: "Class Activation Mappings (CAMs) highlight the features that contribute to the output of the model. In this work, we propose improved variants on Score-CAM through smoothing and an integration function respectively. We visually demonstrate that our methods significantly assist in interpreting models by providing concentrated heatmaps and concrete decision-related features."

##### Abstract

Class Activation Mappings (CAMs) highlight the features that contribute to the output of the model. We present two new variants of Score-CAM:- 1. By a smoothing function to generate localised features. 2. Through an Integration function to furnish sharper axiomatic-based attribution maps. We visually demonstrate that our methods significantly assist in interpreting models by providing concentrated heat maps and concrete decision-related features.
